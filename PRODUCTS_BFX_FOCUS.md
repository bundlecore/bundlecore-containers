# Focus on products/bfx/* Packages Only

## Changes Made

Based on your feedback that there ARE `products/bfx/*` packages available (as shown in your screenshot), I've updated the workflow to:

### 1. Focus ONLY on products/bfx/* packages
- ❌ Removed fallback to `bundlecore-containers/*` packages
- ✅ Only scan bioinformatics tools from biocontainer workflow
- ✅ Ignore private/irrelevant packages

### 2. Enhanced Debugging
- Shows sample of all packages (first 10 only to avoid broken pipe)
- Specifically looks for and displays `products/bfx/*` packages
- Shows related packages if exact match not found
- Safer response handling to prevent pipe errors

### 3. Better Error Messages
- Clear indication when `products/bfx/*` packages are found vs not found
- Specific guidance for biocontainer workflow
- Direct link to check packages

## Expected Behavior

### Success Case (packages found):
```
📦 Package Discovery Results:
=============================
→ Total packages found: 25
→ Sample package names (first 10):
  - bundlecore-containers/augusta
  - products/bfx/bedtools
  - products/bfx/bcftools
  - products/bfx/samtools
  ...
→ products/bfx/* packages found (sample):
  ✓ products/bfx/bedtools
  ✓ products/bfx/bcftools
  ✓ products/bfx/samtools

🎯 products/bfx/* packages found: 6
  ✓ products/bfx/bedtools
  ✓ products/bfx/bcftools
  ✓ products/bfx/samtools
  ✓ products/bfx/star
  ✓ products/bfx/bowtie2
  ✓ products/bfx/deseq2

🚀 Proceeding to scan 6 products/bfx/* packages...
```

### Failure Case (packages not found):
```
📦 Package Discovery Results:
=============================
→ Total packages found: 15
→ Sample package names (first 10):
  - bundlecore-containers/augusta
  - bundlecore-containers/tool1
  ...
→ ❌ No products/bfx/* packages found in response
→ Looking for any packages containing 'products' or 'bfx':
  → None found

🎯 products/bfx/* packages found: 0
❌ No products/bfx/* packages found

💡 This suggests either:
1. The biocontainer workflow hasn't run yet
2. The packages have different names than expected
3. The packages are private and not accessible
```

## Package Types Scanned

| ✅ Included | Package Pattern | Example |
|-------------|----------------|---------|
| ✅ Yes | `products/bfx/*` | `products/bfx/bedtools` |
| ❌ No | `bundlecore-containers/*` | `bundlecore-containers/augusta` |
| ❌ No | Private packages | Any private containers |
| ❌ No | Other patterns | Any other naming schemes |

## Why This Approach

1. **Security Focus**: Bioinformatics tools need specialized security scanning
2. **Relevance**: `products/bfx/*` packages are the intended target for this workflow
3. **Clarity**: Clear success/failure based on finding the right packages
4. **Performance**: Avoids scanning irrelevant private containers

The workflow will now either:
- ✅ **Succeed**: Find and scan your `products/bfx/*` packages
- ❌ **Fail clearly**: Explain exactly why no `products/bfx/*` packages were found
