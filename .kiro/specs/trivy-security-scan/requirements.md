# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature implements automated security scanning for container images published to GitHub Container Registry (ghcr.io) using Trivy. The security scan will identify vulnerabilities in the biocontainer images that are retagged and signed by the existing workflow, focusing on critical and high severity issues. Results will be uploaded to GitHub's Security tab for centralized vulnerability management.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a DevOps engineer, I want automated security scanning of published container images, so that I can identify and track security vulnerabilities in our biocontainer images.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the Trivy security scan workflow runs THEN the system SHALL scan all images published to ghcr.io/{org}/products/bfx/*
2. WHEN vulnerabilities are detected THEN the system SHALL filter results to include only CRITICAL and HIGH severity issues
3. WHEN the scan completes THEN the system SHALL upload results to GitHub Security tab in SARIF format
4. WHEN the workflow runs THEN the system SHALL process all biocontainer tools available in the bfx directory

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a security administrator, I want scheduled weekly security scans, so that I can maintain ongoing visibility into security posture without manual intervention.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the workflow is configured THEN the system SHALL run automatically every week on a specified day
2. WHEN a manual trigger is needed THEN the system SHALL support workflow_dispatch for on-demand execution
3. WHEN the scheduled scan runs THEN the system SHALL process all current images in the registry

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to see security scan results integrated with GitHub's security features, so that I can track and manage vulnerabilities through familiar GitHub interfaces.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN scan results are uploaded THEN the system SHALL use GitHub's Security tab for vulnerability display
2. WHEN vulnerabilities are found THEN the system SHALL create security alerts that can be tracked and managed
3. WHEN the scan completes THEN the system SHALL provide clear status indicators for the security scanning process

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want the security scan to be efficient and reliable, so that it doesn't impact system performance or fail due to resource constraints.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the workflow runs THEN the system SHALL use appropriate GitHub Actions runner resources
2. WHEN scanning multiple images THEN the system SHALL handle failures gracefully and continue processing remaining images
3. WHEN the scan encounters errors THEN the system SHALL provide clear error messages and logging
4. WHEN processing large numbers of images THEN the system SHALL complete within reasonable time limits
