# Final Fix for Broken Pipe Issue

## Problem
Even after previous fixes, the workflow was still failing with broken pipe errors on line 243, specifically in the JSON validation section where we were doing:
```bash
echo "$PACKAGES_RESPONSE" | jq empty
```

## Root Cause
The issue was that even when piping to `jq`, the shell was still trying to echo the entire large JSON response, causing broken pipe errors when the response was too large.

## Solution
Instead of using `echo "$PACKAGES_RESPONSE" | jq`, I switched to using a temporary file approach:

### Before (Broken):
```bash
echo "$PACKAGES_RESPONSE" | jq empty
echo "$PACKAGES_RESPONSE" | jq -r '.[].name'
echo "$PACKAGES_RESPONSE" | jq '. | length'
```

### After (Fixed):
```bash
TEMP_JSON=$(mktemp)
printf "%s" "$PACKAGES_RESPONSE" > "$TEMP_JSON"

jq empty "$TEMP_JSON"
jq -r '.[].name' "$TEMP_JSON"
jq '. | length' "$TEMP_JSON"

rm -f "$TEMP_JSON"  # Cleanup
```

## Changes Made

1. **Created temporary file** - Write JSON response to temp file instead of echoing
2. **Updated all jq operations** - Use temp file instead of piping from echo
3. **Added cleanup** - Remove temp file after processing and in error paths
4. **Safe error handling** - Proper cleanup even when exiting with errors

## Benefits

- ✅ **No more broken pipes** - Eliminates shell pipe buffer issues
- ✅ **Handles large responses** - Can process any size JSON response
- ✅ **Same functionality** - All JSON processing works exactly the same
- ✅ **Clean temporary files** - Proper cleanup prevents disk space issues

## Expected Behavior

The workflow should now:
1. ✅ Successfully fetch large API responses
2. ✅ Process JSON without broken pipe errors
3. ✅ Find and list `products/bfx/*` packages
4. ✅ Proceed to security scanning

## Files Changed
- `.github/workflows/trivy-security-scan.yaml` - Updated JSON processing to use temp files

This should be the final fix for the broken pipe issue that was preventing the workflow from completing successfully.
